# Habitual Calculators

This repository contains the Kickstarter Data Analysis project files.

Our group intends to determine the factors that contribute to a Kickstarter project’s success.  We will start by performing exploratory data analysis to identify any statistical issues such as:  bad or inconsistent data, collinearity, lack of independence of errors, non-normality of errors, and unequal variance of errors. Next, we will look for relationships and correlations between the different Kickstarter campaigns. Examples of questions that we will be looking to analyze:
•	The average pledge amount by Kickerstarter campaign and whether certain categories tend to have larger goals for overall funding
We will be looking at hypothesis testing and statistical significance of the averages
•	If correlation can be determined between pledged amount and backers count by Kickstarter category and whether that leads to a state change of ‘Successful’ vs ‘Failed’

 After the EDA is complete, using various selection methods (AIC, BIC, ML algorithms), we will attempt to build models using our data to answer the questions we have outlined. Our group will be utilizing numpy, pandas, and scipy to help programmatically complete these tasks.  In order to visualize the data, our team will be importing python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn. Our group will then present the data in an analytical format incorporating skills learned throughout the course as well as through our own research.


## Code

You can ignore the .idea file in the repo.  It is related to the Pycharm IDE.

Use the ks.csv (data to analyze) and the ks_Analysis.py files for the project.

If you haven't, install GIT on your machine and clone the project to a directory that works for you.

You'll be able to use Spyder (or any IDE) to edit the files.  Then use GIT to commit and push your changes.

Each time you continue to work, make sure you use GIT to fetch the project.  This updates the files from the project to your machine so you have the latest version with the other team members' changes.
