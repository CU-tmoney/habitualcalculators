# A Data Analysis of Kickstarter Projects 
#### Project Group: Habitual Calculators

This repository contains the Kickstarter Data Analysis project files.

Our group intends to determine the factors that contribute to a Kickstarter projectâ€™s success in several steps:  

1. We will begin by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify any statistical issues including:  bad or inconsistent data, collinearity, lack of independence of errors, non-normality of errors, and unequal variance of errors. 
2. Next our team will clean the dataset and then look to convert categorical and relational columns into integer pointers in order to best parse the data. We can then look for relationships and correlations between the different Kickstarter campaigns. 

##### Questions that we will be trying to answer include:

- The average pledge amount by Kickerstarter campaign and whether certain categories tend to have larger goals for overall funding.
- Analysis on whether a correlation can be drawn between a campain's number of backers and success chance.
- Whether predictions can be made as to the factors that are most closely correlated with a Kickstarter project's success chances.

##### We will also be looking at hypothesis testing and statistical analysis including significance of the averages and regression analysis:

- If correlation can be determined between pledged amount and backers count by Kickstarter category and whether that leads to a project's ultimate success or failure.
-	Logistic regression to train and test the data in order to form a predictive model of success probability.

 After the EDA is complete, using various selection methods (AIC, BIC, ML algorithms), we will attempt to build models using our data to answer the questions we have outlined. 
 
##### How can this data be presented? 

Our group will be using the Numpy and Pandas libaries to cleanse, categorize, and order the dataset. We will then use tools from the scikit ML library to run predictive analysis to guage the factors that contribute to a Kickstarter project's success.  

In order to visualize the data, our team will be using the Matplotlib libary.
 
Our group will then present the data in an analytical format incorporating skills and statistical modeling learned through the course and from our own research.
