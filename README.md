# Habitual Calculators

This repository contains the Kickstarter Data Analysis project files.

## Code

You can ignore the .idea file in the repo.  It is related to the Pycharm IDE.

Use the ks.csv (data to analyze) and the ks_Analysis.py files for the project.

If you haven't, install GIT on your machine and clone the project to a directory that works for you.

You'll be able to use Spyder (or any IDE) to edit the files.  Then use GIT to commit and push your changes.

Each time you continue to work, make sure you use GIT to fetch the project.  This updates the files from the project to your machine so you have the latest version with the other team members' changes.
