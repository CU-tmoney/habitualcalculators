# A Data Analysis of Kickstarter Projects 
##### Project Group: Habitual Calculators

This repository contains the Kickstarter Data Analysis project files.

Our group intends to determine the factors that contribute to a Kickstarter project’s success in several steps:  
1. We will begin by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify any statistical issues such as:  bad or inconsistent data, collinearity, lack of independence of errors, non-normality of errors, and unequal variance of errors. 
2. Next our team will clean the dataset and then look to convert categorical and relational columns into integer pointers in order to best parse the data. We can then look for relationships and correlations between the different Kickstarter campaigns. 

Questions that we will be trying to answer include:
- The average pledge amount by Kickerstarter campaign and whether certain categories tend to have larger goals for overall funding.
- Analysis on whether a correlation can be drawn between a campain's number of backers and success chance.

We will also be looking at hypothesis testing and statistical analysis including significance of the averages and regression analysis:
- If correlation can be determined between pledged amount and backers count by Kickstarter category and whether that leads to a state change of ‘Successful’ vs ‘Failed’.
-	Logistic regression to train and test the data in order to form a predictive model of success probability.

 After the EDA is complete, using various selection methods (AIC, BIC, ML algorithms), we will attempt to build models using our data to answer the questions we have outlined. 
 
##### How can this data be presented? 
 Our group will be utilizing numpy, pandas, and scipy to help programmatically complete these tasks.  
 
 In order to visualize the data, our team will be importing python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn. 
 
 Our group will then present the data in an analytical format incorporating skills learned throughout the course as well as through our own research.
